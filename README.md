Hey everyone, make sure to communicate with your groups through your slack channels and kanban boards.
On Saturday the TA's and I will be going from group to group expecting the following:

- A clear idea of what the app you are building is.
- A list of the libraries and APIs you will be using in the app. Include links to documentation.
- A list of features for the app.
- An idea of who will be in charge of what. This doesn't need to be set in stone, I just want to know you've talked
  about each other strengths and limitations.
- You should be working on the presentation template due on the 20th.

When you are researching APIs you should be trying to set up code snippets for yourself to prove
you'll be able to use it in the app. Organizing Saturdays
